# ACA-Zigbee-SyncLED

## Description
This repository will contain the implementation of a Zigbee-based LED synchronization system developed on the ESP32-C6 platform using ESP-IDF. The project's purpose is to explore synchronized lighting behavior across multiple Zigbee nodes within a dedicated network.

**End Goal:**  
To create a working Zigbee LED synchronization prototype demonstrating multi-device coordination, low-power Zigbee communication, and ESP32-C6 firmware design.

## Tech Stack

**Languages:**  
- To be determined (will use ESP-IDF-supported languages)

**Frameworks / Libraries:**  
- ESP-IDF (planned)

**Tools:**  
- Visual Studio Code  
- ESP-IDF Extension (planned)  
- GitHub

**Dependencies:**  
- ESP32-C6 development board  
- Zigbee stack (via ESP-IDF)  
- Optional sensors or LEDs
